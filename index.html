<p> Welcome to the website for sharing my Music 270 Final Project. </p>
<p> I am undoubtedly not a professional web developer, so please don't expect this website to be mindblowing. </p>
<p> However, it will provide you with a platform to listen to the five beats that I made for this project, each in different styles of hip hop/rap. </p>

<p> First up, the style that I tend toward is trap. </p>
<p> While this is a pretty generic name for a subgenre of hip hop, it can be best identified by a variation of samples with a classic 808 drum pattern w/ quantized 16th note hi hats and 808 bass notes.</p>
<p> This particular piece was inspired by the works of Atlanta producers Wheezy and Turbo. Enjoy. </p>

<p> Up next is my attempt at a NY/UK drill style similar to the beats of axl beats on songs by artists like Fivio Foreign and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx7P_ENnDPE">Pop Smoke</a>. </p>
<p> This style can be recognizd by drum patterns with syncopated, layered hi hats, a very bouncy rhythm, and a synth bass with plenty of glide. The sample or harmonic elements are often dark, minor, and orchestral. </p>

<p> The genre that I have been most excited to experiment with is Reggaeton, a genre that came out of South America, particularly Puerto Rico and Colombia with acts like Bad Bunny and J. Balvin. </p>
<p> It is characterised by syncopated rhythms similar to those of dancehall with punchy, wide drums and occasionally Latin American samples. </p>
<p> My inspiration for this piece was a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xilDDRctnjw">Reloj</a> by Rauw Alejandro and Anuel AA. </p>

<p> The last beat that I made for this project is in the style of boom bap, the style of east-coast 90s rap. </p>
<p> This style can be heard behind rappers like biggie smalls, jay z, etc, and include swung, unquantized rhythms with organic drum sounds and eclectic samples. </p>
